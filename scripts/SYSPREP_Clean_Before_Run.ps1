<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Performs a pre-Sysprep cleanup on a Windows system to prepare it for imaging.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates several cleanup tasks to ensure a Windows system is ready for Sysprep. 
    It should be run with administrator privileges. The script performs the following actions:
      1. Runs Cleanmgr (if available) in verylowdisk mode to clean up system files.
      2. Stops the Windows Update service, removes the update cache, and restarts the service.
      3. Clears all event logs, skipping protected logs.
      4. Deletes temporary files from user and system temp directories.
